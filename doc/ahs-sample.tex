A helicopter can be defined as any flying machine using rotors to provide lift, propulsion and control forces. The rotor produces a lift force equal to the weight of the helicopter and because the generation of this lift force does not require any forward flight speed, the helicopter can rise vertically from the ground and hover. A simpler definition, therefore, is that a helicopter is an aircraft using a rotor (or rotors) that can hover.\end{abstract}\begin{nomenclature}[$C_{p}$]\nomenentry{$A$}{amplitude of oscillation}\nomenentry{$a$}{cylinder diameter}\nomenentry{$C_{p}$}{pressure coefficient}\nomenentry{$C_{x}$}{force coefficient in the $x$ direction}\nomenentry{$C_{y}$}{force coefficient in the $y$ direction}\nomenentry{c}{chord}\nomenentry{d$t$}{time step}\nomenentry{{\it Fx}}{$X$ component of the resultant pressure force acting on the vehicle}\nomenentry{{\it Fy}}{$Y$ component of the resultant pressure force acting on the vehicle}\nomenentry{$f, g$}{generic functions}\nomenentry{$h$}{height}\nomensection{Subscript}\nomenentry{$i$}{time index during navigation}\nomenentry{$j$}{waypoint index}\nomenentry{$K$}{trailing-edge (TE) nondimensional angular deflection rate}\end{nomenclature}\section{Introduction}This document is a \LaTeXe\ template. If you are reading a hardcopyor PDF version of this document, please download the \LaTeXe\ macrosand sample file, \verb|ahs.cls|, from\verb|http://www.vtol.org/index.html| so you can use itto prepare your manuscript. The \LaTeXe\ class file uses onlyComputer Modern (CM) typefaces, which are part of the \TeX/\LaTeX\installation. Use the \LaTeX\ files for formatting purposes, butplease use \verb|ahs.cls| or \verb|ahs.pdf| for specificlayout instructions.  Authors will first need to save the\verb|ahs.cls| to a current/working directory or TeX defaultdirectory. Use italics for emphasis; do not\nobreak underline.For references, which will first appear in the Introduction, AHS uses the style ``...as shown inJohnson (Ref.~\citen{Johnson80a})..." or the other style is ``...which is given inRef.~\citen{Leishman00}." When we deal with a range of citations it is best to use the style  ``...asshown in several sources including Refs.~\citen{Johnson80a,Leishman00,Friedmann93,Chopra85}." The useof the ``cite.sty" package is encouraged, which can be included in the premable to your  \LaTeX\document.\section{Detailed Formatting Instructions}The styles and formats for the AHS Papers class file have beenincorporated into the structure of this document using:-\begin{verbatim}   \documentclass{ahs}\end{verbatim}If you are reading a hardcopy or PDF version of this document, pleasedownload the \LaTeXe\ macros and sample file, \verb|ahs.cls|,from \verb|http://www.vtol.org/index.html| so youcan use it to prepare your manuscript. Use the \LaTeXe files for formattingpurposes, but please use \verb|ahs.cls| or \verb|ahs.pdf| forspecific layout instructions.  Authors will first need to save the file\verb|ahs.cls| to a current/working directory or TeX defaultdirectory.\subsection{Document text}The default font for AHS papers is only Computer Modern (CM)typefaces (12-point size), which are part of the \TeX/\LaTeX\installation. \subsection{Coding your document} Most commands described in this guide are not part of the standard\LaTeX\ package.  The syntax/usage of some commands has been changed,and some commands are newly defined to accommodate the AHS paperstyle.  Such changes are explicitly mentioned in the sections wherethese commands are described. \subsection{Title, authors' names, and affiliations}The title of your paper should be coded as \verb|\title{Title..}|,with capital and lower-case letters, and centered at the top of thepage.  The names of the authors, business or academic affiliation,city, and state/province should follow on separate lines below thetitle. The names of authors with the same affiliation can be listedon the same line above their collective affiliation information.The author name must be coded as \verb|\author{}|.Author names are centered, and affiliations are centered and initalic type. The affiliation line for each author is to include thatauthor's city, state, and zip/postal code (or city, province,zip/postal code and country, as appropriate). The correspondingaffiliation is coded as\verb|\affiliation{Author's Affiliation}|, whichshould immediately follow the \verb|\authorname{}| command.The title, author name, and affiliationmust be followed by the command \verb|\maketitle|.Thus,\begin{verbatim}   \documentclass{ahs}   \begin{document}   \markboth{Author Name}{Article Title}   \title{Article Title}   \author{Name of Author 1}   \affiliation{Affiliation of Author 1}   \author{Name of Author 2}   \affiliation{Affiliation of Author 2}   \maketitle\end{verbatim}\verb|\affiliation{}| command is not part of the standard \LaTeX\ package.The first footnote (lower left-hand side) is to contain the job titleand department name and street address/mail stop, for each author. This can be coded inside \verb|\author{}| command asbelow:- \begin{verbatim}   \author{Author Name\thanks{Insert Job Title,       Department Name, Address       for first author.}}   \affiliation{Business or Academic Affiliation 1,       City, State, Zip Code}\end{verbatim}\subsection{Sections}Use \verb|\section{}| for main section and \verb|\subsection{}| for subsections.\subsection{Headings}AHS style provides 3 levels of section headings and they are alldefined in the \verb|ahs.cls| class file:\begin{itemize}\item Heading 1 -- \verb"\section": bold 12-point font, centered.\item Heading 2 -- \verb"\subsection": bold, flush left.\item Heading 3 -- \verb"\subsubsection": bolditalic, flush left \& first line of the paragraph.%\item Heading 4 -- \verb"\paragraph": italic, run-on with text. \end{itemize}\subsection{Abstract}The abstract should appear at the beginning of your paper. It shouldbe one paragraph long (not an introduction) and complete in itself(no reference numbers). It should indicate subjects dealt with in thepaper and state the objectives of the investigation. Newly observedfacts and conclusions of the experiment or argument discussed in thepaper must be stated in summary form; readers should not have to readthe paper to understand the abstract. The abstract should coded after\verb|\maketitle| command as below:\begin{verbatim}   \maketitle   \begin{abstract}   This is an example of abstract text.  This is an   example of abstract text.  This is an example of   abstract text.   \end{abstract}\end{verbatim}\subsection{Images, figures, and tables}All artwork, captions, figures, graphs, and tables will be reproducedexactly as submitted. Be sure to submit any figures, tables,graphs, or pictures as you want them printed. Companylogos and identification numbers are not permitted on yourillustrations.Place figure captions below all figures; place table titles above thetables. If your figure has multiple parts, include the labels ``a),''``b),'' etc. below and to the left of each part, above the figurecaption. Please verify that the figures and tables you mention in thetext actually exist. {\it Please do not include captions as part of the figures}.When citing a figure in the text, use the abbreviation ``Fig.~\citen{Johnson80a}'' exceptat the beginning of a sentence where you should use ``Figure~\citen{Johnson80a}" . Do not abbreviate``Table.'' Number each different type of illustration (i.e., figures, tables, images)sequentially with relation to other illustrations of the same type.Figures and tables are referred to as `Floats' in \LaTeX, reflectingtheir floating nature. They are typically numbered whether or notthey have a caption and they are floated to the first availableposition near the first reference to that figure/table within thetext.  This is accomplished by placing the figure/table commandimmediately after the paragraph in which they are referred to for thevery first time.An example of coding \verb|{figure}| is given below:\begin{verbatim}    \begin{figure}    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=4.5in]{mouse.eps}}    \caption{This is an example of figure caption.}    \end{figure}\end{verbatim}%\figurebox{10pc}{10pc}{art.eps}%[height][width][filename.eps]Tables can be coded as below:\begin{verbatim}   \begin{table}[b]%[t]   \def~{\hphantom{0}}%   \tbl{This is an example of table caption.   This is an example of table caption}{%   \begin{tabular}{@{}cccc@{}}%   \toprule   First column & Second column & Third column & \\   head$^{\rm a}$  &  head$^{\rm b}$  &  head    &  $V_M(r)$ \\   \colrule   Left    &  Word entries  &~0.2~ & 10.55 \\     Left    &  Word entries  &~0.15 &  33.12  \\    Left    &  Word entries  &10.58 & 45.10 \\    Left    &  Word entries  &43.9~ & 12.34 \\   Left    &  Word entries  &~0.15 & 60.50 \\   \botrule   \end{tabular}}   \tabnote{$^{\rm a}$This is a table footnote.   This is a table footnote.}   \tabnote{$^{\rm b}$This is a table footnote.    This is a table footnote.}   \end{table}%\end{verbatim}\verb|\tbl{}{}| is not part of the standard \LaTeX\ package. \subsubsection{List environment}For lists of items that are complete and/or multiple sentences, use numbers with only the firstline indented. An example of a list is as follows:\begin{enumerate}\item{} This is an example of the first item on a list, but note that only the first line of each item on the list is indented.\item{} Item two follows item one.\item{} Item three, and any other items follow until the end of the list.\end{enumerate}Alternatively, for lists of items given in sentence fragments, use numbers within the paragraph.An example is as follows: 1) Item one, 2) Item two, 3) Item three. The second type of list is preferred, andmost lists will be converted to this form by the typesetter.\begin{verbatim}    \begin{enumerate}      \item{} This is an example of the first item on a list.      \item{} Item two follows item one.      \item{} Item three, and any other items follow until the end of the list.    \end{enumerate}\end{verbatim}\subsection{Equations, Numbers, Symbols, and Abbreviations}Equations are centered and numbered consecutively, with equationnumbers in parentheses flush right, as in Eq. (1). Equation (1) iscoded as below:\begin{verbatim}   \begin{equation}   \int_0^{r_2} \bm{F}(r,\varphi)\,dr\,d\varphi=    [\sigma r_2/(2\mu_0)]\cdot \int_0^{\infty}   \exp(-\rho|z_j-z_i|)\lambda^{-1}    \end{equation}\end{verbatim}A sample equation is included below, formatted using the precedinginstructions. To make your equation more compact, you can use thesolidus ($/$), the exp function, or appropriate exponents.  Useparentheses to avoid ambiguities in denominators.\begin{equation}\int_0^{r_2} \bm{F}(r,\varphi)\,dr\,d\varphi= [\sigma r_2/(2\mu_0)]\cdot \int_0^{\infty}\exp(-\rho|z_j-z_i|)\lambda^{-1} \end{equation}Be sure that the symbols in your equation are defined in the Nomenclature or before theequation appears, or immediately following. Italicize symbols ($T$might refer to temperature, but T is the unit Tesla). Refer to ``Eq.(1),'' not ``(1)'' or ``equation (1)'' except at the beginning of asentence use: ``Equation (1) is.'' Equations can be labeled other than``Eq.'' but should they represent inequalities, matrices, or boundaryconditions. If what is represented is really more than one equation,the abbreviation ``Eqs.'' can be used.\section{Conclusions}The most important results of the paper should be summarized as a concise list of numbered items.Conclusions should be supported by development in the main text and no new material should beintroduced in this section. If the paper did not result in specific conclusions, then the section may be entitledConcluding Remarks or Recommendations, with brief summary comments as appropriate. No references orequations must be cited in the conclusions section.\section{Appendices}An appendix or appendices should be included only for highly specialized data, derivations, and so forth.Appendices should not be used to define symbols. The appendices should be numbered if more than one isused. Each appendix must be cited in the main text.\section{Acknowledgments}The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgments'' in AmericanEnglish is without the ``e'' after the ``g.'' Avoid expressions such as``One of us (S.B.A.) would like to thank…'' Instead, write ``F. A.Author thanks…'' Sponsor and financial support acknowledgments arealso to be listed in the ``acknowledgments'' section.%\vfill\pagebreak\widowpenalty=10000\clubpenalty=10000\section{References}The following pages are intended to provide examples of the differentreference types, as used in the AHS Style Guide.
